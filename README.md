# PARADOX: Pharmacological Analysis of Relation Anomalies and Drug Contradictions Extraction

This repository contains the official research implementation of **PARADOX**, a framework for detecting, validating, and graphically modeling **pharmacological contradictions** in drug–drug relations extracted from biomedical literature.

PARADOX is designed as a **contradiction-aware enrichment layer** over an existing drug relation ontology, enabling more reliable and interpretable biomedical knowledge graphs.



## 📌 Overview

Automatic extraction of drug–drug relations from biomedical text often produces large but noisy relational graphs, where **logical inconsistencies and semantic contradictions** are inevitable. Such contradictions can mislead downstream reasoning, inference, and decision-support systems.

**PARADOX** addresses this problem by introducing a structured pipeline that:

* Identifies candidate contradictory drug relations,
* Expands contradiction hypotheses through semantic similarity (snowball strategy),
* Validates contradictions using **large language models (LLMs)**,
* Constructs a **contradiction-aware knowledge graph** based only on verified evidence.

The framework is evaluated on **PubMed abstracts (2022–2024)** and demonstrates high recall in contradiction detection while maintaining controlled graph complexity.



## 🧠 Methodology

The PARADOX framework consists of five main stages:

1. **Concept Grouping**
   Semantically similar drug concepts are grouped to reduce redundancy and stabilize candidate generation.

2. **Biomedical Sentence Mining**
   Sentences mentioning candidate drug pairs are extracted from PubMed abstracts.

3. **Iterative Contradiction Discovery**
   A multi-step snowball expansion strategy is applied to identify contradiction candidates based on semantic similarity thresholds.

4. **LLM-based Validation**
   Candidate contradictions are evaluated using GPT-based models to remove weak or spurious inconsistencies.

5. **Contradiction Graph Construction**
   Only validated contradictions are represented as edges in the final contradiction graph.



## 📊 Experimental Summary

* **Corpus**: PubMed abstracts (2022–2024)
* **Extracted relational statements**: >18,000
* **Detected contradiction candidates**: 42
* **Validated contradictions**: 39
* **Recall (Contradiction class)**: **92.86%**
* **Final output**: LLM-validated contradiction graph

The pipeline adopts a **recall-oriented detection strategy**, ensuring that critical contradictions are not missed, while downstream validation controls false positives.



## 🔗 Relation to DREaM

PARADOX operates on top of the ontology produced by **DREaM (Drug–Drug Relation Extraction via Transfer Learning)**.
While DREaM focuses on extracting and structuring drug–drug relations, PARADOX refines this structure by identifying inconsistencies, contradictions, and latent relational anomalies.

### 📂 Folder Description

* **data/**
  Contains input resources:

  * biomedical abstracts from PubMed,
  * the drug relation ontology generated by DREaM.

* **code/**
  Contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the PARADOX pipeline.
  Each notebook corresponds to a conceptual stage of the framework and can be executed independently.

* **results/**
  Stores evaluation outputs, confusion matrices, validated contradiction sets, and the final contradiction graph.



## ▶️ How to Run the Code

All experiments are implemented as **Jupyter Notebooks**.
There is no centralized execution script; notebooks are designed for **cell-by-cell reproducibility**.

Recommended execution order:

1. **Train and apply the Siamese similarity model**

   ```
   code/siamese_model_training.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run iterative contradiction candidate expansion**

   ```
   code/contradiction_candidate_expansion.ipynb
   ```

3. **Validate contradictions and construct the graph**

   ```
   code/paradox_pipeline.ipynb
   ```

Each notebook includes explanatory comments and intermediate outputs to support transparency and reproducibility.



## ⚙️ Requirements

The implementation relies on standard Python libraries for NLP and deep learning, including:

* Python ≥ 3.8
* PyTorch
* Transformers
* NumPy / Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

(An explicit `requirements.txt` can be added if needed.)


## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is intended **for research purposes only**.
The extracted relations and detected contradictions should not be used directly for clinical decision-making.
